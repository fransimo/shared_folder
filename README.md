Shared folder

On February 11 I started “Shared folder” a new post photographic project. The objective is download as many as possible pictures shared by emule network users in a supposition that the don’t know that are sharing them.
Among the professional pornography and pedophilia (which I delete) there are thousands of amateur snapshots.
