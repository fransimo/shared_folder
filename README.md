Shared folder

On February 2015, 11 I started “Shared folder” a new post photographic project. 

The objective is download as many as possible pictures shared by emule network users in a supposition that they don’t know that are sharing them.

Among the professional pornography and pedophilia (which I delete) there are thousands of amateur snapshots.
