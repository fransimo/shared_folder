# shared_folder
## 2015 -> 2016 period
On February 2015, 11 I started “Shared folder” a new post photographic project. 

The objective is download as many as possible pictures shared in the e2dk network  in a supposition that 
the users don’t know that are sharing them.

Among the professional pornography and pedophilia (which I delete) there are thousands of amateur snapshots.

## 2021 -> period

The project is reactivated to find out if users are still using e2dk network. [Code](search.ipynb) is available as a Jupyter notebook.

This time search are focused in RAW photography and CV documents.

Finding are being published as NFT to increase the chance of exposure and, eventually, shift the awaerness about 
privacy.
